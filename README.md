# Inverse-Kinematics-Simulator

A real-time 3D program that animates a humanoid character to draw splines on a virtual blackboard

***NOTE***: There is no code posted yet since I'm waiting to receive permission from professor of the course to post full code, but this was done with C++, OpenGL, Tcl/Tk, all in VS Studio.
